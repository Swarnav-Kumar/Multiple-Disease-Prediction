# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease, using Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Logistic Regression algorithms.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in predicting the likelihood of these diseases based on given input features.
